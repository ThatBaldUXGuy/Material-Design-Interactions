# Material-Design-Interactions
A Framer.JS and Framer Studio library of standard Google Material Design interactions


materialInteractions.coffee
Defines material design animations/interactions


materialComponents.coffee
Defines material design components.
Remember, you can import components from Sketch as well. The main reason for defining them in this module instead is if you want to parametrise some of their properties


colors.coffee
As simple as the name, a single file to define any custom colors in


app.coffee
The Framer project's purpose is just to showcase the components and interactions defined above. The idea is that you can use the modules above in any Framer Studio project
