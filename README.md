# Material-Design-Interactions
A Framer.JS and Framer Studio library of standard Google Material Design interactions


## MODULES

### materialInteractions.coffee

Defines material design animations/interactions


### materialComponents.coffee

Defines material design components.
Remember, you can import components from Sketch as well. The main reason for defining them in this module instead is if you want to parametrise some of their properties


### colors.coffee

As simple as the name suggests, a single file to define any custom colors in


### The Framer Studio Project

The Framer project's purpose is just to showcase the components and interactions defined above. The idea is that you can use the modules above in any Framer Studio project

### resources.sketch

This file is also used just for showcasing the interactions build in the above modules, and shown in the Framer project.


## I'm a designer, not a developer
I am hoping that others who find this useful will join in and help build this library of components and interactions.

I enjoy writing code, but am not a developer by trader (I'm a designer), so I'm sure there are many things I could be doing better/more efficiently etc. If you are have suggestion, please get in touch.
